    pub/sub client (RPC based)

    Usage as subscriber:
        Simple usage example (init class with subscription topics):
            client = PubSubClient(["guns", "germs", "steel"], callback_coroutine)
            client.start_client("ws://localhost:8000/pubsub")

        If you want to register separate callbacks per topic:
            client = PubSubClient()
            # guns_coroutine will be awaited on when event arrives on "guns" topic
            client.subscribe("guns", guns_coroutine)
            client.subscribe("germs", germs_coroutine)

        When you are done registering callbacks (once you do, you cannot subscribe to more topics) call:
            client.start_client("ws://localhost:8000/pubsub")

        Another more compact option - using async with -
            async with PubSubClient(["guns","germs"], both_events_coroutine, server_uri="ws://localhost:8000/pubsub") as client:
                # will not end until client.disconnect() is called (by another task / callback)
                await client.wait_until_done()


    Usage as publisher:
            client = PubSubClient()
            client.start_client("ws://localhost:8000/pubsub")
            # Channel must be ready before we can publish on it
            await client.wait_until_ready()
            await client.publish(["Breakfast Options"], data=["spam", "eggs and spam", {"no spam": "egg bacon spam and sausage"} ])
